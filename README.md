# Hi, I'm Mohammadreza (Reza)

I'm a full stack developer with 8+ years of experience building web and mobile applications. I've worked across industries like SaaS, AI, and entertainment, mostly focused on backend systems and making things work smoothly behind the scenes.

I'm also currently teaching web development part-time in Vancouver. I really enjoy breaking down complex ideas and making things more practical for students and new developers.

## About Me

- I mostly work with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **C#**, and **Flutter**
- Iâ€™ve built REST and GraphQL APIs, worked with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and deployed apps using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS**
- I care a lot about clean code, useful documentation, and building things that actually help people

I started out self-taught, and over the years I've learned a lot by working with others, contributing to open source, and just being curious.

## ðŸŒ± Current Project â€“ Vancouver Art Compass

[Vancouver Art Compass](https://vancouverartcompass.ca/) is something Iâ€™m building on the side. It's a mobile-friendly tool to help people find public art around Metro Vancouver.

I know how frustrating commuting can be (especially here and in Toronto), and this is my way of making daily walks or trips a little more fun â€” turning a regular route into a small discovery.

Itâ€™s built with:

- **Flutter**
- **Supabase**
- **Bloc for state management**

If youâ€™re into public art, mobile dev, or just want to help out, feel free to reach out or open an issue. I'm always happy to collaborate.
